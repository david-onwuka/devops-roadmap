# Week 3 — Git Basics

## What I Learned
This week focuses on understanding Git as a version control system used in DevOps and software development.
I am learning how Git tracks changes, manages project history, and supports collaboration using GitHub.

## Topics Covered
- What Git is and why it is used
- Git workflow (working directory → staging → commit → push)
- File states in Git (untracked, modified, staged, committed)
- Checking project status using git status
- Saving changes using git add and git commit
- Viewing history using git log
- Comparing changes using git diff
- Uploading changes using git push
- Downloading updates using git pull
- Cloning repositories using git clone
- Branching basics in Git

## Outcome
I will be able to track file changes, manage project versions, collaborate using GitHub,
and confidently use Git commands in real DevOps workflows.# Week 3 — Git Basics
